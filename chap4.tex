\chapter{Experimental Results}
In this chapter we will review the performance of our various algorithms on different types of worlds. These world showcase various scenarios that a motion planner may be presented with. 
\section{Worlds with Feasible Paths}
The following section is dedicated to worlds that are more common. These are worlds for which there exists a path from a start configuration to a goal configuration without needing to tolerate any collisions. We will look at two such examples: one that is mostly free space, and one that has many obstacles.

\subsection{Simple Minimal Obstacle World}
The first world of this type can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:common_world}.
