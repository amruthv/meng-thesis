\chapter{Conclusion}
In this research paper we have examined existing techniques for motion planning. We looked at bidirectional RRTs, MCR, obstacle ignorant RRTs, iterative obstacle removal RRTs, and search informed iterative obstacle removal RRTs. We are interested in algorithms that are robust to potential scenarios such as planning problems with existing feasible paths and planning problems that require constraint removal to create feasible paths.

Traditional motion planning techniques do not satisfy this requirement since they are not robust to unfeasible planning problems. Additionally, we have shown that MCR often underperforms in bounded iterations by taking a long time to find subpar paths as measured by covers. Amongst the proposed algorithms, we see that the obstacle ignorant RRT is the worst in all scenarios. Between the IOR-RRT and search informed IOR-RRTs, the search informed RRTs are more likely to find collision free paths when they exist, indicating that the best strategy is to use the search informed IOR-RRT. Because the cost of finding paths with collisions when collision free paths exist is high, in an actual planner we recommend that the repeated search informed IOR-RRT. The greedy removal strategy generally outperforms the probabilistic removal strategy in cover score. The greedy removal strategy can also yield a higher success rate when the number of constraint removals allowed (by the choice of removal frequency) is close to the number of constraint removals used by the greedy removal in finding a path which is lower bounded by the true number of constraint removals needed.

The repeated search greedy removal strategy for iterative obstacle removal RRTs is the best choice for use in a planner. While it does not find the best possible path, it instead offers a quick algorithm that can find collision free paths when possible and quickly find reasonably good paths otherwise. This new strategy will allow for more effective planning by communicating the needs of the motion planner to facilitate making feasible paths to the rest of the planner advancing the capabilities of autonomous robots.
